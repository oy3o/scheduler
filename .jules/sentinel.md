## 2024-03-19 - [Fix Stack Trace Leakage in Future API]
**Vulnerability:** The `closureTask[T].Execute` method in `future.go` captured panic payloads, wrapped them in an error along with a full debug stack trace (`debug.Stack()`), and exposed this directly via the `Future.Get()` API.
**Learning:** This implementation leaked sensitive internal application architecture details (stack traces) to upstream callers/APIs. The intention was to feed the stack trace to Gatekeeper's `safeOnError` telemetry hook, but storing it directly in the `Future.err` value exposed it to the public API contract as well.
**Prevention:** Always separate public-facing error states from internal telemetry. Sanitized errors without system details should be presented to callers (e.g., `c.future.err.CompareAndSwap(nil, publicErr)`), while fully contextualized errors (with stack traces) should be routed separately to internal logging/telemetry hooks.

## 2026-03-27 - [Fix DoS via Nil Dereference in Future API]
**Vulnerability:** The `SubmitFunc`, `SubmitVoid`, and `Join` methods in `future.go` accepted `nil` values (nil functions or nil futures) without validation. Submitting a nil function would cause a runtime panic (`nil pointer dereference`) when executed by the Gatekeeper loop.
**Learning:** Even if the core subsystem (`Gatekeeper.Submit`) has nil validations, wrapper APIs or higher-level abstractions must also validate their inputs independently. Assuming downstream will handle it causes the wrapper itself to trigger a panic (e.g., executing `nil` closure).
**Prevention:** Always implement defensive programming at every public API boundary. Check for nil callbacks or objects before allocating resources or wrapping them into tasks to fail securely and gracefully.

## 2025-05-15 - Exposure of Debug Stack Trace in Future API
**Vulnerability:** Information disclosure via multiline panic payloads in the Future API using alternative vertical whitespace characters (e.g., carriage return `\r`).
**Learning:** The previous fix truncated payloads at `\n` to prevent stack trace leakage. However, using alternative vertical whitespace characters like `\r` can bypass this check and expose the stack trace, or introduce log spoofing vulnerabilities.
**Prevention:** Always use `strings.IndexAny` or similar to truncate payloads across all standard vertical whitespace characters (`\n\r\f\v`).
